## Classification by Identification of analytical nature on O*NET occupations.  

- Open Script.rmd in Rstudio 
- run the script (it will auto install all libraries needed)
- analyses are included in the rmd as well the HTML and PDF knits of the script.

(Use HTML as the code chunks in pdf do not wrap)

Description- 

The ONET database has a wide variety of worker and job oriented data categories. The ONET Content
Model provides the framework that identifies and organizes this important information about work. The
O*NET-SOC Occupation Taxonomy covers work performed in the U.S. economy and defines the set of
occupations for which data is collected.
The ONet is now the primary source of occupational information. It is sponsored by ETA through a grant
to the North Carolina Department of Commerce. Thus, it is a rich database with a sizable ampunt of
information of very high quality.
This is script deals with the task of classifying a given occupation from the the ONET database by implementing
a model to estimate a probability of an occupation being Analytical in nature. After spending
some time looking around on the ONET site, Relevant tables that contain possible promising features were
identified and data was aqucisitoned, cleaned and transformed to create a feature matrix on which modelling
was done to predict an occupation being analytical.
